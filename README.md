Here I picked up the skill of functionality through javascript and built myself from there, learning the basics including arrays and loops.

Using this website, people can use the provided filters to find a suitable contract for their mobile phone. The website as a whole consists of a simple validation page for the user to fill in before they can access the main page, then follows a search page where they can filter the provided options and display the results generated from their selection.
